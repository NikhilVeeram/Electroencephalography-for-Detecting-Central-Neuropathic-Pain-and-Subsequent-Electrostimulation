**How to run the model on your computer:** Download the .ipynb file to your computer; run it on Jupyter, VS Code, or another IDE of your choice; and observe the results. (NOT DONE)

**Purpose:** To simulate, analyze, and differentiate Electroencephalogram data gathered from various non-CNP/CNP patients based on spiking rates. Subsequently, to correspond biologically-inconsistent spiking instances with those found in patients with Chronic Neuropathic Pain (CNP), distinctly creating corresponding, destructively-interfering electrical signals to return the errant neuronal spikes to a baseline status.

**How to change parameters of interest:**
- The sampling frequency (automatically set to 512 Hz: 512 samples of brain polarization at a certain regions are captured every second) can be altered using ...
- The EEG data inputted can be altered, also possibly affecting the number of electrodes (NOT DONE)
