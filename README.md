**How to run the model on your computer:** Download the .ipynb file to your computer; run it on Jupyter, VS Code, or another IDE of your choice [Note: Jupyter is recommended to visualize EEG wave structure in real time]; and observe the results. (NOT DONE)

**Purpose:** To simulate, analyze, and differentiate Electroencephalogram data gathered from various non-CNP/CNP patients based on spiking rates. Subsequently, to correspond biologically-inconsistent spiking instances with those found in patients with Chronic Neuropathic Pain (CNP), distinctly creating corresponding, destructively-interfering electrical signals to return the errant neuronal spikes to a baseline status.

**Datasets Utilized:**
EEG CNP Dataset: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/yj52xrfgtz/2
Eyes Open/Eyes Closed Dataset (Control): https://dataverse.tdl.org/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.18738%2FT8%2FEG0LJI

**How to change parameters of interest:**
- The sampling frequency (automatically set to 250 Hz: 250 samples of brain polarization at a certain regions are captured every second) can be altered using ...
- The EEG data inputted can be altered, also possibly affecting the number of electrodes (NOT DONE)
